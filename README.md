# BadUSB WiFi2TG 🦆💾

Welcome to the *super sneaky* WiFi credential tester by [@saikonohack](https://t.me/saikonohack)! This BadUSB script is your ticket to learning how those mischievous USBs tick—**strictly for educational shenanigans**! 😜 Use it wisely, or you'll end up on the naughty hacker list! 🚨

## How to Use 🛠️

Ready to dive into the USB-powered fun? Follow these steps to unleash the magic:

1. **Snag the Script** 🎣  
   Grab the script from this repo faster than you can say "free WiFi"!

2. **Crack It Open** ✍️  
   Pop the script into your favorite text editor—Notepad++, VS Code, Sublime Text, or even plain ol’ Notepad (no judgment here!).

3. **Get Your Bot Token** 🤖  
   Swap out `<BOT_TOKEN>` with the shiny token you nab from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). He’s basically the Santa of Telegram bots! 🎅

4. **Who’s Getting the Goods?** 🕵️‍♂️  
   Replace `<USER_OR_CHAT_ID>` with your Telegram user ID or the chat ID where your bot’s hanging out. Pro tip: [GetMyIDBot](https://t.me/getmy_idbot) will spill the beans on your ID faster than a gossiping parrot. 🦜

5. **Stash It Safely** 🔒  
   Save the script and beam it up to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) as a **secret gist**. No secret gist, no cookie—public gists let randos swipe your token! 🍪

6. **Grab the Raw Deal** 🌐  
   On your Gist page, hit the "Raw" button and copy the URL like it’s the last slice of pizza. 🍕

7. **Shrink That Link** 🔗  
   Head to [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/) and turn that chunky URL into a cute, bite-sized link. Adorable *and* functional!

8. **Tweak the Payload** 💉  
   Download `payload.txt` from this repo, swap `<your_link>` with your TinyURL masterpiece, and save it like it’s your high score in a retro arcade game. 🕹️

9. **Beam It to Flipper** 🐬  
   Plug in your Flipper Zero (the coolest dolphin in tech) and slide `payload.txt` into any folder in the BadUSB module. Easy peasy!

10. **Profit!** 💰  
   Fire up the payload and watch the educational magic happen. Cue the confetti! 🎉

## Pro Tips & Giggles 😎

- **Stay Stealthy**: Secret gists are your BFF—don’t let your bot token end up on a hacker’s vision board! 🕶️
- **Don’t Be *That* Guy**: This is for learning, not for stealing your neighbor’s WiFi to binge cat videos. Be a hero, not a zero! 🐱
- **Flipper Vibes Only**: Make sure your Flipper Zero is ready to rock the BadUSB party. Update that firmware if it’s feeling cranky! 🎸

## Disclaimer (aka The Serious Bit) ⚖️

This tool is for *edutainment* only—think of it as a science experiment, not a supervillain starter kit. The author’s not liable if you try to pull a fast one and end up grounded by your router. 😇

Go forth and geek out, you magnificent tech wizard! ✨ *May your payloads be smooth and your WiFi signals strong!* 🚀
